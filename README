Save Newcastle Libraries
========================

Newcastle City Council plans to close down 10 libraries across
the city as part of its next budget proposal. This represents
the closure of more than half of the existing branches across
Newcastle.

This map shows how the different branches would be affected, based 
on the [Library Network Reduction](http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/drupalncc.newcastle.gov.uk/files/wwwfileroot/your-council/budget_and_annual_report/budget_2016_-_9_-_library_network_reduction_0.pdf) (PDF 115Kb) Proposal.

Click on a branch to see how to contact your local councillor to raise your concerns, as well as other ways to get involved.
